This is (so far) a status API to keep track of upness or downness of services at various sites. It is mostly a super thin layer on top of a Cassandra database.

Architecturally, it is very simple.

<nginx/apache> -> <flask app server> -> <cassandra cluster>

The nginx and flask apps are completely stateless, allowing for easy horizontal scalability. There is no complex authentication systems required, only HTTP Basic over SSL. The cassandra cluster (as well as the web front ends) should scale across multiple datacenters and regions to allow for the most resiliency with the service.

INSTALLATION
  ./newb
  # CONFIGURE
  ./cassandra.ddl.py

USAGE:

  Pull the latest status:

    curl -u admin:testing localhost:5000/api/v1.0/status/today

  Update a service:

    curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X \
      POST -d '{"site":"localhost","service":"testing","message":"nominal","state":1}' \
      localhost:5000/api/v1.0/status
